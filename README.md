# OOAD, UML, Methodology and Architecture Design Practice Tutorial

## Overview

This project is designed as an intensive bootcamp-style learning program focused on building practical software engineering skills considering the model standardization. The curriculum covers Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, Unified Modeling Language, design patterns, software development methodologies, and system architecture design. The primary objective is to develop real-world competencies in a short timeframe through structured study and hands-on practice with digital twin model architecture design.

## Purpose

The project aims to provide comprehensive training in software design and architecture fundamentals. It emphasizes practical application of theoretical concepts through systematic study of industry-standard materials and methodologies. The learning path progresses from foundational tools and concepts through advanced design patterns and culminates in practical implementation exercises.
